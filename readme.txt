Please make sure you install all the necessary packages you need depending on a MacOS 
or Windows system that you are using. Please refer to the MacOScommandlines and Windowscommandlines for
which libraries you need to install and make sure you have on your computers.

Navigate to the main "flask and python integration (main code)" folder and run the Flask.py file and open it
on your browser using the http: IP link Please make sure that all the files are all in one folder.

Our project is able to help students code C++ and Python. It can also help you create schedules for syllabuses that you
paste in for the bot to analyze, and it can also provide websites and links to morgan's ciriculum websites if you need
assitance with the steps in your major.


Overview
This project integrates GPT functionality with Python and Flask to create a fine-tuned AI solution. It includes training, fine-tuning, and configuration scripts, along with a Flask application to demonstrate integration.

Project Structure

1. Flask and Python Integration
Contains the main code for the Flask application.
- Files:
  - `.env`: Environment variables for Flask configuration.
  - `Flask.py`: Main application logic.
  - `get-pip.py`: Script to install pip.
  - `HOW TO USE`: Guide to running the Flask app.
  - `templates/`: HTML templates for the web interface.

2. GPT Python Files
Scripts for fine-tuning and configuring GPT models.
- Files:
  - `file-training.jsonl`: JSONL training data.
  - `fine-tuner.py`: Fine-tunes the GPT model.
  - `GPT-configuration-settings.py`: Model configuration script.
  - `training-file-creator.py`: Creates JSONL files for training.
  - `training-file-uploader.py`: Uploads training data.

3. GPT Training and Functionality Screenshots
Screenshots documenting the project's progress.
- **Screenshots:**
  - Code snippets (e.g., `fine tuner code.png`, `training file creator code.png`).
  - Training and testing results (e.g., `Test1.png`, `Test6 (TicTacToe).PNG`).

How to Use
1. Navigate to the `Flask and Python Integration` folder.
2. Configure the `.env` file with the necessary environment variables.
3. Run the `Flask.py` script to start the application.
4. Use the scripts in the `GPT Python Files` folder for training and fine-tuning as needed.
5. Refer to the screenshots in `GPT Training and Functionality Screenshots` for guidance.
