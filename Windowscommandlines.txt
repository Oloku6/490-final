****Note******:
If you're on Windows, you don't need to worry about Linux-specific tools like Homebrew. The above steps for managing packages are native to Windows. Let me know if you'd like more details or run into any issues!

* ALSO NOTE On Windows, Homebrew isn't available by default. You will need to rely on pip3 for Python-related installations.*
